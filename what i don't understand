when we make a class we can makes instances of the class, however, i still don't underatand why we cannot iterate all of the instances
e.g.

class Computer():
  def __init__(self, brand1, brand2, brand3):
  self. brand1 = 'brand1'
  self.brand2 = 'brand2'
  self.brand3 = 'brand3'
  
site1 = Computer(apple,hp,dell)  
  
#trying to iterate through
for instances in site1:
  print(instances)
  
#this will bring up a 'this is not iterable method'
#doing researched i have found a way to iternate over the instances

def __iter__(self):
def __next__(self):
raise StopIteration

# setting these 3 up only allow me to iterate over the 1 attribute from the instance e.g. self.brand1
# do not understand why not
