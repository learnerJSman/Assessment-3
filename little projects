#simple beginer projects/ideas i found on the internet which i could try. No answers so lets see where i will get

# pynthon needs to import this code to run the random number function
import random

# number guessing game

# generate a random number between 1-20
# def random_number():
a = random.randint(1, 20)
# the actual code does not need to be in a function. that was for testing purposes

# working out if the code generates a random number. appears to work fine
# i = True
# while i:
#    answer = input('Would you like to generate a random number yes or no? ')
#    if answer.lower() == 'yes':
#        random_number()
#    elif answer.lower() == 'no':
#        i = False

# save randomly generated number in a variable
i = True
while i:
    num = input('Please guess a number between 1-20: ')
    #make sure that we are guessing a number using the int() function
    if int(num) == a:
        print('congratulations you got it correct!')
        i = False
    else:
        print('incorrect: ')
